# SwiftProjects
I have recently started learning about IOS app development and here you can find a couple of my first applications developed in swift.

Main goal of creating these applications was to learn about the basics of swift such as auto layout and UI components.
One of the application has a centered button which when pressed cycles colors in the corneres of the device, while the other one takes an input string and converts
it to numbers after which the string is displayed. The pattern used is the one from old phone keyboardsor example if the characther is A, B or C it translates it to 2, 
if it is D, E or F it translates it to 2 and so on.
